# Karazah Valuation

## About
Karazah Valuation is a comprehensive business valuation package created for potential acquisition discussions with Abdullah Shahin. The project provides detailed financial analysis, asset valuation, brand assessment, and market positioning documentation for Karazah Channel, enabling informed negotiations and transparent deal structuring.

Built with HTML5 and designed for web-based presentation through GitHub Pages, the valuation package includes content library assessment, intellectual property valuation, audience reach metrics, revenue projections, and comparable market transactions. The presentation format allows for cross-device access and easy sharing with potential investors and partners while maintaining professional formatting and data visualization.

Development began in December 2025 with the comprehensive valuation package completed in a single intensive development session. The project achieved deployment capability with dedicated sync scripts for multi-device access. Currently at 40% completion, remaining work includes additional market comparables, updated financial projections, and supporting documentation for due diligence processes.
