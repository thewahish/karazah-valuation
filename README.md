## COPPA Compliance Impact

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act significantly affects Karazah's monetization:

| Feature | Before COPPA | After COPPA (2020+) |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| Advertising | Personalized/targeted | Contextual only |
| CPM Range | $3-$5 general | $0.20-$0.55 kids |
| Comments | Enabled | Disabled |
| Notifications | Enabled | Disabled |
| End Screens | Enabled | Disabled |
| Subscriber Value | $2-$4/sub | $0.50-$0.75/sub |

**Valuation Implication:** All projections use COPPA-adjusted rates. This is why subscriber valuation is $376K-$564K (not $1.5M-$3M like general audience channels).

## DCF Methodology

### Discount Rate Build-Up (19-23%)

| Component | Rate | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Risk-Free Rate (US 10Y) | 4.17% | Investing.com |
| Equity Risk Premium | 4.60% | Damodaran |
| Country Risk (MENA) | 0.60-0.80% | Damodaran |
| Size Premium (Micro-Cap) | 3.50-5.00% | Kroll |
| Company Specific Risk | 5.00-8.00% | Platform + key person |
| **Total** | **18.87-22.57%** | Rounded: 19-23% |

### DLOM (Discount for Lack of Marketability): 30%

Applied to final equity value for illiquidity, per Investopedia and Grant Thornton guidelines.
